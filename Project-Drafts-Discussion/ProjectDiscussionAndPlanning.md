## Collaboration and Communication

1. What form of communication will work best for all of your when you need to discuss your project and make decisions? For example, will you use Slack, Discord, text messages, email, in-person meetings etc.?

- We will use Discord to communicate.

2. How often do you think you should meet as a group to discuss your project? How long should these meetings be? What should you do if you can't make a meeting?

- We will meet in person if we are all on campus. We will meet on discord if we are at different place. We will meet 2 times a week as a group to discuss our project. We will leave messages on discord so that everyone can look over them.

3. What are some strategies you can use to make sure everyone is contributing to the project? How will you make sure everyone is on the same page? How will you hold each other accountable?

- We will assign tasks to each person, and update our progress to ensure everyone is on the same page. We will check each other every time we meet. 

4. As a group, what are you overall goals for the project? What strategies will you use to make sure you meet these goals?

- Our overall goal for the project is to complete the assignment using a combination of tools we learned in class and new methods. We will break each step down and complete them. We will also have an overall foundation plan of what we need to accomplish, and track which tasks we have or have not completed.

## üìç Project Planning

### Roles
- Araynah & Yihan - Send out weekly reminders for project goals that week and upcoming deadlines
- Everyone - Come up with questions to answer based off of for galaxy modeling.Find useful data sets to use.

### Short Term Goal
- think about research questions - due on Monday (4/6)
- do research on galaxy - due on Monday (4/6)
- think about a timeline for this project - due on Monday (4/6)

### first meeting
- discord meeting, Sat (4/5) 8:00 pm

## Updated plan
1. Deciding on number of galaxy types (4 currently) 
2. Making number of data points in each class even
3. Train test split and prediction code with sklearn
4. Can visualize data individually (feature vs y) to see which feature category is the best predictor of galaxy type and which have least correlation
5. Can also include other visualizations/plots; class separation using svm in 2d (or even 3d), finding best features with permutation_importance
add docstrings
6. Write analysis of data results and abstract once bulk of the code is written
7. Slides show plan: Address what the research question is,Add what we hope to accomplish, Problems we have initially faced, tools and topics related to class we will be using. 
8. Once the first model is completed, choose another model/method. Compare the results of this model to the first model to determine which is more accurate.
